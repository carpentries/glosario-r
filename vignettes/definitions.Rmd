To get a single definition, you just need to pass a slug with the term you want defined.

```{r setup}
library(glosario)

g <- get_glossary()

define('data_frame', lang = 'en', glossary = g)
```

If you don't know the exact slug for the term you're searching, don't worry. Type the term as close as you remember and `define` will try to match it to the closes term we have available.

```{r}
define('data frame', lang = 'en', glossary = g)
```

`define` is not constrained to a single language. In one code chunk you can define terms both in English and French, for example.

```{r}
define('slug', lang = 'en', glossary = g)
define('slug', lang = 'fr', glossary = g)
```
